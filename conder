I really love traveling, and cooking, as well as eating. My favorite place that I have visited, I would<br>
 have to say would be Hawaii. I just got back from Orlando, FL, and went to Universal Studios. I would highly <br>
 recommend going there, because it is quite amazing all the detail that went into the park, and the different rides.<br>
 I have to say though, the Harry Potter portion was my favorite part of the park. I plan on going to California, hopefully<br>
 next year.
